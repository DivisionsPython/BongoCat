## 🔗 Documentation

[**Future docs website, needs to be developed**](#)

## 🛠️ Technical description

This bot is built with [**Cogs**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html?highlight=cog#cogs), this means that the commands are separated in different files and directories, so they can be sorted by categories.

Each file contains the commands regarding its category, and those files get loaded by the main file, [**main.py**](main.py)

The bot owner ([**MadKarma**](https://discord.com/users/826489186327724095)) has the access to the [**Cogs loader**](./owner/extensions.py) commands.
